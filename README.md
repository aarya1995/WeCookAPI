# WeCookApi
API for WeCook Database requests

HEY GUYS I'M MAKING THIS FROM MEMORY SO IF YOU RUN INTO ANY ISSUES LET ME KNOW
STEPS TO RUN API LOCALLY
  1) INSTALL NODE/NPM
  2) USING NPM IN CONSOLE, INSTALL EXPRESS, MONGOOSE, AND NODEMON
  3) IN CONSOLE, GO TO API LOCAL DIRECTORY AND TYPE '$ nodemon'
    - DONT TYPE THE $ THAT IS JUST SHORTHAND FOR CONSOLE LINE
  4) YOU SHOULD GET SOME SUCCESS COMMANDS THAT API IS RUNNING PROPERLY AND WHATNOT
    - ANYTIME YOU MAKE CHANGES TO THE API, YOU CAN RESTART IT BY TYPING $ rs in console while nodemon is running
  5) OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD THIS IS IT, BUT IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY PROBLEMS JUST MESSAGE ME AND I'LL TRY TO SORT IT OUT
